        <div class="post-meta"><time class="post-date">2025-11-09</time><span class="post-author">KC</span></div>

        

        


        <div class="post-content">
          
            <p>This post was supposed to come out at the beginning of November. However, I&rsquo;m not very used to uploading consistently to any platform with a post button, so that is something I must work on.</p>
<h2 id="whats-happening-this-november">What&rsquo;s happening this November?</h2>
<p>This November, I&rsquo;m continuously updating R.C.M.M. to what I&rsquo;d consider an acceptable state to leave it in for a short while. Simply put, here&rsquo;s the rest of the content I&rsquo;m working to add/improve upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated UI (<a href="https://github.com/KidWizardOfTheWeb/ReaperCo.ModManager/commit/55bf8fb27b3e0446a0e0ca3d9a4ed35d6355c73f">already pushed to the GitHub repo as of this post!</a>).</li>
<li>Self-Updating functionality (learning to do this with Github&rsquo;s API).</li>
<li>Plugin support (allowing users to add external python scripts to perform special actions).</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m also continuing my job hunt, as I am going on 5-6 months of job searching since June.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t lie, some days it gets difficult to even press on. You do work towards certifications, build projects, try to tidy up your resume before sending it out into the rat race of other applicants, all while [the US] economy is basically about to hit or is already in a recession. There&rsquo;s pressure everywhere. But more than not, there&rsquo;s self-made pressure as well.</p>
<p>I have a lot of plans and ideas that I wish to share with the world, but I need a job for stability and growth potential. Right now, only one company has bit my line, and then I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for the competitiveness of the other applicants to swoop up the positions last minute. It gets demoralizing, honestly. The fact that, in order to have outreach and have a stable start to your life, you need something that feels genuinely unobtainable unless the whims of fate smile upon you. Fate has not been kind, unfortunately.</p>
<p>When it comes to my projects, I&rsquo;m fiercely passionate. If you put something in front of me and say &ldquo;I need you to architect, develop, and deploy a solution for this&rdquo;, I will get after it and relish in the whole process. It&rsquo;s how I had to build most of my game development career, where the projects I&rsquo;ve contributed to needed someone to design and polish new mechanics and new ideas. The whole process of design to deployment is an art and a science, where you must know your context in order to create something that fits and you must know the heart of the player to create something that will give them long-lasting memories that they won&rsquo;t forget. You create to engage, to delight, to improve upon life in such a way where the impact becomes timeless. That is why software development is special to me. Even if I&rsquo;m not explicitly developing games for an audience, I still wish to improve upon people&rsquo;s lives with software that connects to people in a real way.</p>
<p>ThirdSpace was my attempt at this. While it has been a few months off of working on the project due to my small team and I being busy with other endeavors, it is still a project I wish to see to completion. I guess this is as good of a time as ever to give the story of ThirdSpace.</p>
<h2 id="thirdspace-putting-the-humanity-back-in-social-media">ThirdSpace: putting the humanity back in social media</h2>
<p>One day, I was watching videos about the old 2000s era internet. Being someone born in 2003, I got to experience the midpoint to end of this era (I was using the internet right about when YouTube started, for reference). Back then, things were much more scrappy. Not just because the technology wasn&rsquo;t as advanced as it is now, but because the people behind it weren&rsquo;t concerned with being the most professional or proper. They wanted to be <em>themselves</em>. The farther along we&rsquo;ve come in making technology, the more we&rsquo;ve lost what parts of ourselves went into it. There&rsquo;s just too much of a corporate feel now when it comes to your modern social media platforms. Corporations were built on efficiency first, not humanism. They way they see it, the minute you focus on humans is the minute you add chaos to the order of things.</p>
<p>Not being the most avid social media user, the issues that this mindset posed was lost on me until I heard a lot of my friends complaining about not having a real platform for themselves and their art/works. Everyone is categorically the same in terms of setup, bar their picture and banner at most. This makes it all too easy for someone to lose track of what sets them apart from others, which with the original goal of social media being &ldquo;express yourself&rdquo; and the opposite being what&rsquo;s true today just ruining the precedent.</p>
<p>Thus, the concept of ThirdSpace spawned out of a yearning for expression, art, and being who you really wanted to be.</p>
<p>At first, a few ideas were thrown around for the main concept of the app. One idea was connecting the digital world to real life by mapping out physical locations to sites on ThirdSpace itself, allowing users to chat with people who were physically at that location or digitally connected to that location. Privacy concerns did exist, so that one was thrown out.</p>
<p>The website idea came around while working on creating a new website for Sonic Riders Tournament Edition, where we needed full flexibility to create our own layout, but the simplicity of creation and publishing using Wix was desirable as well. The problems with Wix were payments to host the site, creation being slow and laggy, and page management being somewhat clunky overall. By taking the good parts of the site (the GUI editor) and combining it with the flexibility of something like MySpace had, then we could create a site that made hosting yourself as easy as possible with all the extra bits and bobs people could think of. Thus, our main idea was born.</p>
<p>Even after all of this, there&rsquo;s still more work to do in setting up the whole system from top to bottom. As I am learning to become more proficient on frontend, the backend constantly changes due to database schema being updated over time. This is why we do UML diagrams after all. I&rsquo;ll be getting back to this project soon.</p>
<h2 id="making-content">Making Content?</h2>
<p>I have always wanted to create content and post it online. The few times I&rsquo;ve made a YouTube video, or made a guide, or anything of the sort, it was the most enjoyable payoff at the end seeing people interact with it. While I am currently jobless like most of my other recently graduated peers, it might behoove me to create more content on what I know. My interests are somewhat niche after all, and from what I have gathered from peers, they would also be interested in, well, my interests.</p>
<p>Namely, the Sonic Riders series and Ollie King has a lot of information that I&rsquo;ve gathered from reverse engineering and researching them over the years, and not a lot of people cover the technical side in-depth. That&rsquo;s where I would come in, demonstrating the underlying systems that keep those games running.</p>
<p>Riders in particular is an area that is barely covered on the technical side while having so much research done for it (Ollie King has some research, but not enough right now to explain the gameplay systems for it). Most of the other Riders devs that have existed to create mods like TE and DX are no longer active, unlike me, who is still kicking after 3-4 years and making new tools like R.C.M.M. to allow others to interface with the game on a deeper level.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;d really want to talk about is the actual code itself. Although somewhat messy in it&rsquo;s vanilla version, now that a decompilation exists, we can detail how almost everything in the game works. What&rsquo;s more is that I&rsquo;ve been recompiling parts of the game to C/C++ code over the years while working on TE, making it easier for others to comprehend and write supporting code. Many gameplay systems such as the state system, gear mechanics, 3D movement, and other mechanics have so much potential for videos, yet I&rsquo;ve never fully committed to making any. There are a lot of players who</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the best at editing by far, but I love writing scripts (just as I&rsquo;m doing right now writing this). It&rsquo;s not something I share with others often, but ever since I&rsquo;ve set up this website, it gives me a space to express myself more without being restrained in character count or formatting. I&rsquo;ll be working with others in order to try and make some videos soon, no date on those since I&rsquo;d have to stick to a schedule first.</p>
<h2 id="going-into-december">Going into December</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be starting up some old projects again in December (namely ThirdSpace). It&rsquo;s about time I start making software for all, and I&rsquo;ll be posting my ko-fi link soon for tips. Before, I was able to get on just fine without requesting much from my audience. But as the economy looks shaky, the option will now be present. No tiers, no subscriptions, just if you like what I make, send a ko-fi (I think that&rsquo;s how they say it).</p>
<p>I wish to start making games again in January, but I&rsquo;ll see how December goes first. Already have some design documents made, might revisit an old idea.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading November&rsquo;s update! Stay tuned for beginning of December if I don&rsquo;t get wrapped up in projects again.</p>

<h2 id="rcmm---a-file-management-solution-for-gamecube-mods">R.C.M.M. - A file management solution for GameCube Mods</h2>
<p>At the time of writing (when I started this website), this is my most recent venture (I&rsquo;m pretty proud of it quite honestly).</p>
<p>My aim was to fix a common issue with developing mods involving file changes to emulated GameCube and Wii games, which is build and file management.</p>
<h3 id="the-story">The story</h3>
<p>While I was developing Sonic Riders Tournament Edition (SRTE), most of the time players were generally discouraged from modifying the game in any way due to being unable to play together with someone if they do not have the <em>exact</em> same setup as you. That meant <strong>no custom models or music packs</strong> unless you gave the other player an Xdelta (file used to modify a base file into the target output) and have them patch their game copy.</p>
<p>Xdelta is a file that contains all diffs between a base and a target file. This could take anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour to compile, since you cannot multithread the bitchecks it has to run on everything. If even one byte is out of place, the whole program could be out of commision.</p>
<p>This was a hassle, as the mod creator always had to update the <strong>Xdelta</strong> patcher every time a new patch for Tournament Edition was released to stay up to date. In fact, mods like <a href="https://github.com/akaneia/akaneia-build/releases">Akaneia</a> for Super Smash Bros. Melee still use Xdelta to this day to patch their game.</p>
<h3 id="the-xdelta-problem--trying-for-longterm-growth">The Xdelta problem &amp; trying for longterm growth</h3>
<p>For longterm releases with smaller/more inconsistent playerbases, this is fine. But for longterm growth on the other hand, Xdeltas only hamper the entire onboarding process. Not only do you have to make it work for those who cannot operate their filesystem on a regular basis, but even something as simple as &ldquo;drag-and-drop&rdquo; cannot be taken for granted as a skill anymore (I&rsquo;ve learned this the hard way while developing tools for general usage).</p>
<p>Longterm growth was my goal, so fiddling with Xdeltas was out of the question. With SRTE, I ended up developing a patcher that automatically grabs updates from a server we host the delta files on (shoutout to <a href="https://github.com/sewer56">Sewer56</a> for their implementation of delta patch files) and patches the files locally after retrieval. All the user had to do was make sure they had .NET 7 and place the ISO in the proper folder.</p>
<p>Even then, the workflow still looked like this to make a new patch and retrieve it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compile the extracted files into an ISO (&lt;1 min)</li>
<li>Use Sewer&rsquo;s delta generator to generate base ISO/new ISO hashes and patch files (15-30 minutes)</li>
<li>Test ISO (5-30 minutes, depending on changes added).</li>
<li>Upload to server (30 minutes).</li>
<li>Test server retrieval with patcher (&lt;1-2 minutes on my computer &amp; network).</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s about an hour to create new files, test, release, and test the release each time. And if you screw up something or leave something in? Gotta redo the whole process. Every time I upload a new patch for SRTE, I am anxious 100% of the way through for that reason. It&rsquo;s happened before, and it&rsquo;ll happen again.</p>
<h3 id="studying-other-solutions-hedgemodmanager">Studying other solutions: <a href="https://github.com/thesupersonic16/HedgeModManager">HedgeModManager</a></h3>
<p>Last year, I played Shadow Generations and got to use a little program called HedgeModManager for the first time. I&rsquo;ve never really done PC game modding before, and I marveled at how simple it was to operate and understand. The connectivity with GameBanana blew my mind at the time as well. I just couldn&rsquo;t fathom how the connection from website to launcher worked so well and effortlessly.</p>
<p>So when I thought of making a mod manager, HedgeModManager became my idea of a perfect manager. Their repository was easy enough to comprehend what the general idea for implementing their systems was, but there was a general difference between the types of games handled in my situation versus PC.</p>
<p>See, PC games use clients like Steam or Epic to handle versioning, file management, and storage. With Sonic PC games, file and code injection was the main methodology to make mods run, using .dlls to do the injections.</p>
<p>With games you run on Dolphin (GameCube/Wii), the story is a bit different. You can extract the files from any given ISO and still play said extracted files as a full ISO. Replacing those files (with valid ones ofc) also works, as Dolphin will load whatever is requested by the game and if it follows the file path/file name convention. So for my version of a mod manager, the basis had to be <strong>layering</strong> instead of injection.</p>
<p>Knowing this, I sketched out a few possible ideas on how this could work. Python is always on my mind for simple solutions quick (it really is a &ldquo;do-everything&rdquo; kind of language, I love it), and when I revisted some of my older projects for inspiration, dictionaries (hashmaps) stuck out to me as a solution. Python&rsquo;s specific collision handling implementation had a certain behavior that mirrored my idea of layering perfectly. So, I got to work immediately.</p>
<h3 id="the-conceptual-workflow-of-rcmm">The conceptual workflow of R.C.M.M.</h3>
<p>R.C.M.M.&rsquo;s workflow goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a game to the mod manager. This uses DolphinTool as a subprocess to extract the ISO to a new directory in a mods folder, named after the game ID.</li>
<li>The extracted ISO is then used as a &ldquo;base case&rdquo; for laying mods on top of. Think of it like a smoothie bowl, where you need a base to put your toppings on top of, otherwise the toppings do nothing on their own.</li>
<li>Any mods the user turns on will then calculate a database file for all the files in said mod. This database is actually a dictionary (hashmap) of all the files, which has an important paradigm in the python implementation that we&rsquo;ll use later. The extracted ISO also has it&rsquo;s own database.</li>
<li>Once all mods are turned on and the user is ready to save, when pressing the save button, all database files are combined. The way this works revolves around hashmap collision handling. Python has a really neat way of handling when it detects two of the same keys between dictionaries:</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say dictionary A has key-pair <code>{bigKeyGuy: fooValue}</code> and dictionary B has key-pair <code>{bigKeyGuy: barValue}</code>. If the operation <code>dictionary A + dictionary B</code> happens, python will detect two <code>bigKeyGuy</code> keys exist and <em>replaces the value of the dictionary being added to</em>.</p>

<p>Using this behavior, I designed a database schema for the base ISO, the modded output ISO, and each mod.</p>
<p>Essentially, all we have to do is record:</p>
<ul>
<li>The subdirectories of the mod (&ldquo;sys&rdquo;/&ldquo;files&rdquo; for GameCube).</li>
<li>What files exist in the ISO/mod.</li>
<li>Where the original directory was.</li>
<li>The hash of the file (for file integrity purposes).</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of the schema using a mod that includes a sys folder with a .dol and a single file replacement in the files folder:</p>

<p>Now when dolphin loads the modded ISO directory, all of the modded files are already included and ready to be played. Best part is, if other users turn on the same mods as you, you can play your mods online with each other!</p>
<h3 id="initial-release-and-conclusion">Initial release and conclusion</h3>
<p>So far with the first release (along with bugfixes) of R.C.M.M., the SRTE community has been able to use their music and model mods together online. You can check out some creations in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/sonicriders">Sonic Riders Competitive</a> Showcase channel. More features are planned for R.C.M.M. in the future to make implementation even easier for users (and hopefully a proper binary for full release). There might be some caveats like sending files manually for now, but the modpack specs mean that it&rsquo;s as easy as adding a folder and dropping in and refreshing the window.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently asking around for other GameCube games and seeing where R.C.M.M. can do some good. If you have a game you&rsquo;d like to try, give <a href="https://github.com/KidWizardOfTheWeb/ReaperCo.ModManager/tree/master">R.C.M.M.</a> a shot!</p>
<p>This is also the first project I&rsquo;m releasing under the Reaper Co. moniker. I hope to release more over time and maybe even garner a team. But that&rsquo;s for the future.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading my first post! You can message me on discord at <code>kid.chameleon</code> or leave an issue on my GitHub for new changes!</p>
