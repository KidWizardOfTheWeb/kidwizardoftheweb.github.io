## Introduction

This site serves as an extension of my resume, as well as where I house my lifetime portfolio of side projects (I have many).
I also post regularly about the things I do in the Posts section, so check that out for the latest updates. 

### For hiring managers reading more about me from my resume:

For more about me, my work history, and relevant skills towards the tech industry and computer science, check out these pages:
- [**About**](/about)
- [**Job History**](/job-history)
- [**Portfolio**](/portfolio)

### For other people just stopping by:

Feel free to peruse at your leisure! All my projects in [**Portfolio**](/portfolio) have links as well if you want to check them out (exception to projects I've contributed to that are no longer hosted on the internet).
