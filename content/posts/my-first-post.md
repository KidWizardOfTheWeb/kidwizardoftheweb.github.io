## Introduction

This site serves as an extension of my resume, as well as where I house my lifetime portfolio of side projects (I have many).
I also post regularly about the things I do in the Editor's Desk section, so check that out for the latest updates. 

Hint: The text at the top that reads `C://Reaper Co.` leads back to here (the homepage).

### For hiring managers reading more about me from my resume:

For more about me, my work history, and relevant skills towards the tech industry and computer science, check out these pages:
- [**About**](/about)
- [**Job History**](/job-history)
- [**Portfolio**](/portfolio)

### For other people just stopping by:

Feel free to peruse at your leisure! All my projects in [**Portfolio**](/portfolio) have links as well if you want to check them out (exception to projects I've contributed to that are no longer hosted on the internet).

For business matters, connect with me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/samir-masih/

I might add other social media as I see fit in the future.
