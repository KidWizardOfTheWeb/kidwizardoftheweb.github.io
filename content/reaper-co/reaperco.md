## What's Reaper Co.?

Most of the software I produce on my own (2025 and onward) go under the moniker **Reaper Co.**

This originated from a skate truck company that someone and I wanted to create. Only some designs were made, and the name. 

The name really did stick with me though, and I liked the tagline a lot:
### "We carve the stuff of dreams."
So I've decided to keep it as a form of branding for my projects. A title for a company (even if I am the only one currently in it). One day, I hope to register the trademarks needed and run it as my own.

Projects such as [ThirdSpace](/portfolio/thirdspace) and [R.C.M.M.](/portfolio/rcmm) fall under this authorship, as well as future releases like [Ollie King's Unity Remake](/portfolio/ok).

I hope to see you supporting **Reaper Co.** out there when things start launching more often!
