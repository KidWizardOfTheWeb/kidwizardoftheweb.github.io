## What's Reaper Co.?

Most of the software I produce on my own (2025 and onward) go under the moniker **Reaper Co.**

This originated from a skate truck company that someone and I wanted to create. Only some designs were made, and the name. 

The name really did stick with me though, and I liked the tagline a lot:
### "We carve the stuff of dreams."
So I've decided to keep it as a form of branding for my projects. A title for a group (even if I am the only one currently in it).
