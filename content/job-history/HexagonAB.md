## Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) Lifecycle Intern
#### June 2024 - August 2024
In my time at Hexagon, I developed skills regarding web development and cloud services, namely AWS. A team comprising of 3 other interns and I developed full stack applications using Django as a web framework, with HTML, CSS, and JS as our frontend. 

For our first web application, our intern team developed a brand new build deployment page for the EAM division that would automatically access their APIs for the latest build information and automatically update at set times, depending on time zones.
My role was to develop the backend functionality to obtain information from the APIs, organize it into JSON data that the server would store, and update the front-end at the correct world times for international teams.

The second web application we created referenced the statistics from AWS services such as EC2 instances and DynamoDB to display graphs relating to uptime, access rates, and where traffic was being accessed.
I was in charge of handling the retrieval of information from AWS resources and synthesizing the data to create graphs using pandas (python graphing module) that update in real time.

This internship in particular was extremely influential for me, as Django became a premiere choice for all of my web development needs. It helped me develop projects such as "MangoDjango" a final college senior year project revolving around using Agile methodologies and Azure in order to create a driver rewards app from top to bottom. It's also what inspired me to develop my main current project, [ThirdSpace](/portfolio/thirdspace).
